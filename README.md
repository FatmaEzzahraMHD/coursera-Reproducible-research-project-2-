Impact of Severe Weather Events on Population Health and Economic life.  

This project explores the **NOAA storm database**, which tracks major storms and weather events, to explore the most severe types of weather events in the USA causing the greatest damage to the human life in term of injuries  and the economic life during the years 1950 - 2011.   

There are two goals of this analysis:   

 *identify the weather events that are most harmful with respect to population health   
 *identify the weather events that have the greatest economic consequences.
